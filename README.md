PYGMENTS-ELM
============
An [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) lexer for [pygments](http://pygments.org)

> Work in progress

Inspired by the lackluster syntax highlighting for Elm on GitHub, as well as the opportunity to contribute to an open-source project and brush up on my Python a bit, this project hopes to make the world a better place.

Tradeoffs
---------
* Markdown - punt on this by calling it all just a string, or actually use multiple lexers?
* webgl - same as for Markdown

Status
------
Current plan is to get the standard libraries and operators working.
