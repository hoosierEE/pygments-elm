PYGMENTS-ELM
============

An [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) lexer for [pygments](http://pygments.org)

> Work in progress

Inspired by the lackluster syntax highlighting for Elm on GitHub, as well as the opportunity to contribute to an open-source project and brush up on my Python a bit, this project hopes to make the world a better place.

This repository is basically a clone of [pygments-j](https://github.com/hoosierEE/pygments-j), so this readme is short.
