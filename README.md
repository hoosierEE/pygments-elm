PYGMENTS-ELM
============
An [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) lexer for [pygments](http://pygments.org)

> Work in progress

Inspired by the not-wonderful syntax highlighting for Elm on GitHub, as well as the opportunity to contribute to an open-source project and brush up on my Python a bit, this project hopes to make the world a better place.

**EDIT** There's already an issue open for this at [pygments](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issue/986/support-for-elm-language).

Tradeoffs
---------
* webgl - call it a string or actually lex it as the C-like language it is?
* Markdown - same. Does Pygments even have a lexer for highlighting Markdown source as Markdown?

Status
------
Current plan is to get the standard libraries and operators working.
